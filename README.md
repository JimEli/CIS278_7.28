# Pima CC CIS278 
## Week #9 Exercise 7.28 
### Palindrome Recursive

Exercise 7.28 on page 335-336, Palindromes.
A palindrome is a string thatâ€™s spelled the same forward as backward. Examples of palindromes include "radar" and "able was I ere I saw elba"

Write a recursive function testPalindrome that returns true if a string is a palindrome, and false otherwise. Note that like an array, the same brackets ([]) operator can be used to iterate through the characters in a string.
